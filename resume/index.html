	<h3>Cover Letter</h3>

	<p>I believe you will find me well qualified for the position of Project Management Director. I will not be the most experienced candidate you interview, but my technical skills, attention to detail, and knowledge of Lexington and LFUCG make me the ideal candidate for this position.

	<p>Projects are made of milestones, tasks, and resources. In order to bring a project to completion you must reach each milestone by completing the neccesary tasks, using available resources. A system of tracking all of these elements will allow stakeholders to have real-time access to project progress, allow managers to keep projects on track, and create a database of project information that can used to value engineer future projects, negotiate fees, and develop best practices to be used throughout government.</p>

	<p></p> 

	<p>If you have any questions about my qualifications or my approach to project management, please contact me at any time at 859.552.5292 or by email at <a href="#">jmholl5@gmail.com</a>.

	<p>Thank you,</p>

	<p>Jonathan Hollinger</p>
